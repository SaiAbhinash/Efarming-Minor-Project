                <h3>Yield Prediction</h3>
                <p>Yield prediction, one of the most significant topics in precision agriculture, is of high importance for yield mapping, yield estimation, matching of crop supply with demand, and crop management to increase productivity. Examples of ML
                    applications include in those in the works of [74]; an efficient, low-cost, and non-destructive method that automatically counted coffee fruits on a branch. The method calculates the coffee fruits in three categories: harvestable,
                    not harvestable, and fruits with disregarded maturation stage.The aim of this work was to provide information to coffee growers to optimise economic benefits and plan their agricultural work.

                <h3>Disease Detection</h3>
                <p>Disease detection and yield prediction are the sub-categories with the higher number of articles presented in this review. One of the most significant concerns in agriculture is pest and disease control in open-air (arable farming) and
                    greenhouse conditions. The most widely used practice in pest and disease control is to uniformly spray pesticides over the cropping area. This practice, although effective, has a high financial and significant environmental cost. Environmental
                    impacts can be residues in crop products, side effects on ground water contamination, impacts on local wildlife and eco-systems, and so on. ML

                <h3>Weed Detection</h3>
                <p>Weed detection and management is another significant problem in agriculture. Many producers indicate weeds as the most important threat to crop production. The accurate detection of weeds is of high importance to sustainable agriculture,
                    because weeds are difficult to detect and discriminate from crops. Again, ML algorithms in conjunction with sensors can lead to accurate detection and discrimination of weeds with low cost and with no environmental issues and side
                    effects.ML for weed detection can enable the development of tools and robots to destroy weeds, which minimise the need for herbicides.
